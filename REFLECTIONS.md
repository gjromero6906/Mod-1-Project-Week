1. Share one aspect of building this project you found challenging and how you overcame it.

Learning about enums and learning where to start. I'll be honest I knew I wanted 3 classes one to handle the flow of code ,one for just the inputs and out put and then one for actual game logic, i used chat gbt for an out line and went from there then it suggested enums since i kept getting errors with miss spelling rock in some of the lines and incorporated from there,I really enjoy them still need some more practice before I am confident to use them without help.

```
Start
├── creates Game
├── creates Menu(Game)
└── controls loop

Menu
├── asks user for input
├── calls Game.playRound()
└── reads Game scores

Game
├── holds rules
├── updates scores
└── returns results
```

2. Share one technical concept that you gained a deeper understanding of through building this project. Explain that concept in simple terms and explain how it is used in your project.

Imports and Exports of classes basically from my understanding its like boxes that will only share with each other if they have the key to get in. I exported and imported enums and the other classes so they are able to give information or receive so i would need to repeat code.
